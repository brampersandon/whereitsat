I was born in this hotel,
Washing dishes in the sink.
Magazines and free soda,
Trying hard not to think.
Heaven’s drunk from the poison you use.
Charm the wolves with the eyes of a gambler.
Now I see it’s a comfort to you.
Hammer my bones on the anvil of daylight.
Holding hands with an impotent dream.
In a brothel of fake energy.
Put a nickel in the graveyard machine.
I get higher and lower,
I get higher and lower
Like a tired soldier
With nothing to shoot
And nowhere to lose
This bottle of blues.
Now I’m a straight-line walker
In a black-out room,
I push a shopping cart over
In an Aztec ruin.
Sawdust songs of the plaid bartenders,
Western Unions of the country westerns,
Silver foxes looking for romance
In the chain-smoke
Kansas flash dance ass pants.
She’s got a cactus crown
With a dot dot dot on her brow,
And she speaks inside a cloud
With her countenance turning around.
Let the desert wind
Cool your aching head,
Let the weight of the world
Drift away instead.
I quit my job blowing leaves,
Telephone bills up my sleeves.
Choking like a one man dustbowl,
Freedom rock slime ball
Talking in code.
We went down,
Lit up the shack,
Grab me a beer out of the sack.
Tonight the city is full of morgues
And all the toilets are overflowing.
There’s shopping malls
Coming out of the walls
As we walk out among the manure.
She’s got cigarette on each arm
She’s got the lily-white cavity crazes
She’s got a carburetor tied to the moon
Pink eyes looking to the food of the ages
Brief encounters in Mercedes Benz,
Wearing hepatitis contact lens,
Bed and breakfast getaway weekends
With Sports Illustrated moms.
The fields of green
Are bent, obscene
I lay upon the gravel
A worm of hope
A hangman’s rope
Pulls me one way or the other
Titanic, fare thee well,
My eyes are turning pink.
Don’t call us when the new age
Gets old enough to drink.
Your brains went black
When she took back her love,
And put it out into the sun.
The birds did fly
When the heavens all went dry,
And the cigarettes were smoking by themselves.
Love machines on the sympathy crutches,
Discount orgies on the dropout buses.
Hitching a ride with the bleeding noses,
Coming to town with the brief case blues.
There’s a place where you are going
You ain’t never been before
No one left to watch your back now
No one standing at your door
That’s what you thought love was for
I remember the way that you smiled,
When the gravity shackles were wild,
And something is vacant
When I think it’s all beginning.
Now you’ve had your fun,
Under an air-conditioned sun.
It’s burned into your eyes,
Leaves you plain and left behind.
There’s a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know,
A place we saw the lights turn low
The jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow.
You can’t write if you can’t relate,
Trade the cash for the beef
For the body for the hate,
And my time is a piece of wax
Falling’ on a termite
Who’s choking’ on the splinters.
